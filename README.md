# Change-Background

A short python program to change a windows background to a random image from https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/.

Note: Only works on 64bit Windows, 32bit will probably just get a black screen

To Do:

-Put the login details for reddit in a seperate file for security reasons.
-Change the hardcoded directory where the image downloads to.
